## Key Concepts

### Basic Concepts

* Defines what a computer is: a programmable machine that processes data according to instructions.
* Introduces essential terms like **hardware**, **software**, and **architecture**.
* Highlights the distinction between abstract models and physical implementations.

### Units of Measurement

* Explains units used in computer science and engineering:

  * **Data size**: bit, byte, kilobyte, megabyte, gigabyte, etc.
  * **Time/performance**: Hertz (Hz) for clock speed, MIPS/FLOPS for performance.
  * **Storage vs. memory**: binary (powers of 2) vs. decimal (SI prefixes).
* Clarifies common confusions, e.g., 1 KB = 1024 bytes in binary context vs. 1000 bytes in SI.

### History

* Traces the evolution of computing machines:

  * Early mechanical devices (abacus, Pascal’s calculator, Babbage’s analytical engine).
  * The advent of electromechanical and vacuum tube computers.
  * Transition to transistors, then integrated circuits.
  * Modern microprocessors and the rise of personal computers.
* Emphasizes how architecture evolved alongside technological advances.

### Types of Computers

* Classifies computers based on size, purpose, and architecture:

  * **Supercomputers** – extreme performance for scientific tasks.
  * **Mainframes** – large-scale data processing and enterprise use.
  * **Minicomputers** – mid-range, often for specialized applications.
  * **Microcomputers** – personal computers, desktops, laptops.
  * **Embedded systems** – computers integrated into everyday devices.
* Highlights differences in processing power, cost, and application fields.

## Notes & Reflections

* This chapter sets the stage by combining theoretical, historical, and practical views.
* Understanding measurement units and terminology is essential before delving into processor design.
* The historical perspective shows how technological innovations shaped architectural choices.
* The classification of computer types helps students relate abstract concepts to real-world systems.
